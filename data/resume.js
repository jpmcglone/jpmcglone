    bio: "I design and build high-quality iOS applications and help teams collaborate more effectively to deliver exceptional products. With over 15 years of experience, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with and leading development at companies like Rumble, DocuSign, and Imgur, where my apps have reached millions of users. My expertise spans the full tech stack, though my passion and expertise lies in iOS development, where I excel most at crafting scalable, reliable products and solving complex technical challenges.\n\nBeyond coding, I enjoy collaborating and mentoring other developers, streamline engineering processes, and introducing best practices to projects to empower teams to ship better software, sooner. I have a deep affinity for SwiftUI, which I have been using since its launch, and I continuously refine my approach to integrating new technologies while maintaining clean, reusable, and maintainable codebases. Whether building from the ground up, improving existing systems, or leading technical strategy, I thrive on delivering ambitious ideas with a focus on both speed and quality."
