I was thinking about the term "non-believer", and it doesn't really work for the way that I think about Truth.

I mean, I guess it *could* make sense, but if you believe in Truth itself, and you aim to understand and honor it, you're not merely a "believer" -- that makes Truth sound like superstition. 

A belief in Truth itself? That seems belittling.

It's not a mere belief--no, it's a statement of certainty; a conviction.

"Follower" of Truth might work. And maybe "seeker" of Truth. I don't tend to say "God" when talking about this topic, because I don't think others think of "God" in exactly the same way; although they might think of God as Truth itself, they think God is more than that. That God isn't just Truth, but that Truth is an extension of God. I don't see the difference, but I've had this debate many times now.

"Follower", "seeker", "believer"... "child" of Truth itself.

The more I explore this idea of "God is Truth itself", the more I think this is precisely what our ancestors actually understood "God" to be.

Perhaps what the bible describes is the (loosely put) "personality" of Truth itself, which is sort of like how a lake or a yard has a personality (even though they're "just" manifestations of nature).

"Truth"--is all that is (and all that was, and all that will ever be), and it certainly has a personality! (The Old Testament illustrates that personality very well.)

So this is just some food for thought. Do you seek, follow or believe in Truth itself? Or do you think reality is an illusion, or something else entirely?
