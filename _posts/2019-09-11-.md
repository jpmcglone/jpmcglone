"Non-believer" doesn't really work. Not for the way that I think about Truth.

I mean, I guess it can make sense, but if you believe in Truth itself, and you aim for it, you're not merely a "believer" -- that implies that Truth is just a belief.

A belief in Truth itself? That seems so belittling.

It's not a mere belief--no, it's more a statement of certainty; a conviction.

"Follower" might work (of Truth itself). And maybe "seeker" (again, of Truth itself). I don't say "God" because I don't think others think of "God" in exactly the same way. 

"Follower", "seeker", "believer"... "child of Truth itself".

The more I explore this idea of "God is Truth itself", the more I think this is what our ancestors actually understood "God" to be.

Perhaps what the bible describes is the (loosely put) "personality" of Truth itself, which is sort of like how a lake or a yard has a personality (even though they're "just" manifestations of nature).

"Truth"--is all that is, and it certainly has a personality! (And the Old Testament illustrates that personality very well.)

So this is just some food for thought. Do you seek, follow or believe in Truth itself? Or do you think reality is an illusion or something else entirely?
