Born in Brooklyn, NY, John studied Computer Science in Long Island. He began his career in app development in 2009 and went on to work for several notable companies including [Imgur](https://www.imgur.com), [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com), and [Workday](https://www.workday.com). He’s given remote talks (over Facetime) at Hofstra and Nassau Community College on the topics of personal development and career success.

John now lives and works in North Carolina, is a software developer, landlord and entrepreneur. He’s a tech enthusiast, avid gamer, VR aficionado, and has been involved in the improv scene for several years.

Viewing the world through a psychological, rather than sociological, lens, John can be described as a classical liberal who cares very much about free speech and individual sovereignty. He is inspired by the work of professor [Jordan Peterson](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/) and hosts a Study group in Raleigh, NC twice a week to share and discuss his ideas. A proponent of liberty, personal freedom and reason, John has become an outspoken critic of progressive leftist ideology and aims to raise awareness about what’s at stake.
