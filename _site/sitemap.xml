        <title>God is Truth itself</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Non-believer” doesn’t really work. Not for the way that I think about Truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I guess it can make sense, but if you believe in Truth itself, and you aim for it, you’re not merely a “believer” – that implies that Truth is just a belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A belief in Truth itself? That seems so belittling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a mere belief–no, it’s more a statement of certainty; a conviction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Follower” might work (of Truth itself). And maybe “seeker” (again, of Truth itself). I don’t say “God” because I don’t think others think of “God” in exactly the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Follower”, “seeker”, “believer”… “child of Truth itself”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I explore this idea of “God is Truth itself”, the more I think this is what our ancestors actually understood “God” to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps what the bible describes is the (loosely put) “personality” of Truth itself, which is sort of like how a lake or a yard has a personality (even though they’re “just” manifestations of nature).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Truth”–is all that is, and it certainly has a personality! (And the Old Testament illustrates that personality very well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is just some food for thought. Do you seek, follow or believe in Truth itself? Or do you think reality is an illusion or something else entirely?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to my new blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who know me already, you know that I post quite a lot across my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JPMcGlone&quot;&gt;social&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/thejpmcglone&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/thejpmcglone/&quot;&gt;accounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of those posts have become lengthier (and more thought out) blog posts over on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jpmcglone&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; profile, and although I enjoy posting to that site overall, I didn’t love that the blog belonged to “medium dot com” and not “jp mcglone dot com”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here we are. Welcome to www.jpmcglone.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of this blog will likely update over the months (and maybe even years). I built and deployed this blog using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator written in ruby, which uses a format called &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/&quot;&gt;Front Matter&lt;/a&gt; that is easy to work with (and export later, if I ever need to).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to share my ideas here, write public letters, talk about programming, and much more. So make sure to bookmark this site and visit regularly!&lt;/p&gt;
