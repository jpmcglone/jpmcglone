With over 15 years of experience, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with and leading development at companies like Rumble, DocuSign, and Imgur, where my apps have reached millions of users. My expertise spans the full tech stack, though my passion and expertise lies in iOS development, where I excel most at crafting scalable, reliable products and solving complex technical challenges.

Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborating and mentoring other developers, streamline engineering processes, and introducing best practices to projects to empower teams to ship better software, sooner. I have a deep affinity for SwiftUI, which I have been using since its launch, and I continuously refine my approach to integrating new technologies while maintaining clean, reusable, and maintainable codebases. Whether building from the ground up, improving existing systems, or leading technical strategy, I thrive on delivering ambitious ideas with a focus on both speed and quality.`},objective:"My objective is to lead a team building exceptional products and enhancing engineering team efficiency while maintaining high standards for code quality, user experience and developer experience.",technicalSkills:[{category:"Languages",skills:[{name:"Swift",featured:!0},{name:"Objective-C",featured:!0},{name:"JavaScript",featured:!0},{name:"TypeScript"},{name:"Ruby"},{name:"PHP"},{name:"Java"}]},{category:"Frameworks",skills:[{name:"SwiftUI",featured:!0},{name:"UIKit",featured:!0},{name:"Nuxt.js",featured:!0},{name:"SnapKit"},{name:"Lottie"},{name:"Combine"},{name:"FLAnimatedImage"},{name:"LiveKit"},{name:"Apollo (GraphQL)"}]},{category:"Databases",skills:[{name:"PostgreSQL"},{name:"Realm"},{name:"MySQL"},{name:"SQLite"},{name:"MongoDB"}]},{category:"Dependency Managers",skills:[{name:"Swift Package Manager",featured:!0},{name:"Cocoapods",featured:!0},{name:"Carthage"},{name:"Bundler"},{name:"npm"}]},{category:"CI/CD",skills:[{name:"CircleCI",featured:!0},{name:"Fastlane",featured:!0},{name:"GitHub Actions"},{name:"Travis CI"},{name:"Jenkins"},{name:"Azure DevOps"}]},{category:"Monitoring",skills:[{name:"Sentry"},{name:"Crashlytics"},{name:"HockeyApp"}]},{category:"Analytics",skills:[{name:"Amplitude"},{name:"Mixpanel"},{name:"Firebase"},{name:"Facebook Analytics"}]},{category:"Development Tools",skills:[{name:"Xcode",featured:!0},{name:"Cursor",featured:!0},{name:"VS Code"},{name:"Vim"},{name:"JetBrains tools"},{name:"AppCode"}]},{category:"Networking",skills:[{name:"Alamofire",featured:!0},{name:"AFNetworking"},{name:"URLSession"}]},{category:"Issue Tracking / Wiki",skills:[{name:"JIRA",featured:!0},{name:"Linear",featured:!0},{name:"GitHub",featured:!0},{name:"Notion"},{name:"GitLab"},{name:"Bitbucket"},{name:"Confluence"},{name:"Pivotal Tracker"},{name:"Phabricator"}]},{category:"A.I.",skills:[{name:"ChatGPT",featured:!0},{name:"Cursor",featured:!0},{name:"Claude"}]},{category:"Miscellaneous",skills:[{name:"Next.js"},{name:"React"},{name:"GraphQL"},{name:"JSON"},{name:"YAML"},{name:"dotenv"},{name:"xcconfig"},{name:"Regex"},{name:"XML"}]}],experience:[{company:"Rumble",title:"Lead iOS Developer (Rumble Studio)",period:"2023 -
